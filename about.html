        <h1 class="b-heading b-overline">WHY BLOCKCHAIN UNN</h1>
        <!-- overview -->
        <h3 class="sub-heading">OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p>Like a Tsunami, Blockchain technology is advancing and gradually disrupting every industry, redefining the world or work and how things are done. However, the majority are still ignorant of the revolution pioneered by technology.
        <br /><br />
        Hence, there is an urgent need for human capital development to prepare and empower humans with the right knowledge and skills needed to leverage the opportunities the space 
        presents. On this basis, BlockchainUNN was founded.
        </p>

        <!-- who we are -->
        <h3 class="sub-heading">WHO WE ARE</h3>
        <p>BlockchainUNN is a Tech community established to educate members of the University Community with both basic and advanced practical knowledge of cryptocurrency, Blockchain technology, its development, and its opportunities. Though we are focused on the University of Nigeria, we have a diverse community made up of people from diverse fields, institutions, and campuses who are blockchain enthusiasts.
        </p>

        <!-- overview -->
        <h3 class="sub-heading">OUR MISSION</h3>
        <p>To educate and develop community members ( students and lecturers) of the University of Nigeria, on different facets and applications of Blockchain technology.
        </p>

        <!-- overview -->
        <h3 class="sub-heading">OUR VISION</h3>
        <p>To be the best campus Blockchain community in Africa with members contributing positively to the Blockchain ecosystem, and the growth of Nigeria and Africa at large. 
        </p>

        <!-- overview -->
        <h3 class="sub-heading">THE PROBLEM</h3>
        <p>There are over 65,000 members of the University community. But only about 10% understand Blockchain Technology. The remaining 90% are ignorant of what Blockchain Technology is all about. Also, they do not understand the opportunities in the space.  
        <br /><br />  
        Annually, the institution graduates over 5,000. 18% make it with the rest being overtaken by poverty and oblivious of the mind-blowing opportunities Technology poses for them.
        " The same is the case with several Universities in Nigeria and Africa." We decided to begin charity at home by addressing the widespread ignorance on our campus.
        </p>

        <!-- The solution -->
        <h3 class="sub-heading">THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>
            To encourage the use of Blockchain technology to solve problems in Africa, we push for the massive quality education of young people on Campus.<br>
            Higher institutions are the biggest community of young people. What we currently have today, is a community of young uninformed people. What we aim to achieve is education, one cannot utilize what he or she does not understand.
            Through our weekly activities, master classes and conferences, we educate people on:<br /><br />
